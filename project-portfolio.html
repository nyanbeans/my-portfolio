        <h4 tabindex="0" class="single-sub-subheader">Planning</h4>
        <p class="single-work-description">
            The stages of this project can be broken down into a 
            few main steps:
        </p>
        <ol class="process-list">
            <li>Research</li>
            <li>Content planning</li>
            <li>Sitemap creation</li>
            <li>Wireframing and style tile</li>
            <li>Development</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="single-work-description">
            I created a detailed content plan with several lists of what 
            content was to be featured in my portfolio. This included:
        </p>
        <ul class="process-unordered-list">
            <li>Which pages to have (home page, project pages) </li>
            <li>What sections each page should have </li>
            <li>What content should be in each section</li>
            <li>Additional notes with thoughts and potential features</li>
        </ul>
        <p tabindex="0" class="single-work-description">
            The content plan was created with consideration of key points 
            I'd noted down during research:
        </p>
        <ul class="process-unordered-list">
            <li>An 'about' section can be short and sweet</li>
            <li>Project summaries with links to more details is common</li>
            <li>The 'whys' are just as important as the 'hows'</li>
            <li>The portfolio itself can also be a showcase piece</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="single-work-description">
            After putting together the content plan, I created a rough 
            wireframe. I wanted most information to be accessible without 
            having to leave the home page, so I featured my projects right 
            below the landing area; visitors are prompted to scroll down by 
            the text and animated arrow at the bottom of the section. If a 
            project catches the visitor's eye, they can click on the 'see 
            details' button to look into my process and thinking. If they 
            are intrigued after reading through my process, there is a 
            contact button conveniently placed right below it.
        </p>
        <p class="single-work-description">
            I then proceeded to put together a moodboard for 
            the portfolio, beginning with a picture of newsprint as the 
            starting point—as I knew I wanted to aim for something with a 
            very clear structure—and evolving to a high-contrast but clean look. 
            Following the moodboard, I created a simple style tile to guide 
            the look of the site.
        </p>
        <div class="lightbox-gallery">
            <a href="images/moodboard_lightbox.jpg" data-lightbox="portfolio-showcase-design" data-title="Moodboard for portfolio"><img src="./images/moodboard_lightbox_preview.jpg" class="single-project-images portfolio-preview" alt="moodboard for portfolio"></a>
            <a href="images/style_tile_lightbox.JPG" data-lightbox="portfolio-showcase-design" data-title="Style tile for portfolio"><img src="./images/style_tile_lightbox_preview.jpg" class="single-project-images portfolio-preview" alt="style tile for portfolio"></a>
        </div>
        <p class="click-instruction">Click images to enlarge.</p>

        <p class="single-work-description">
            The red accent ended up being less prominent in the final site, 
            only appearing on elements with focus states. This was done so 
            keyboard users would be able to see where they are on a page 
            more clearly.
        </p>

        <h4 tabindex="0" class="single-sub-subheader">Development</h4>
        <p class="single-work-description">
            After the style tile was made, I moved into the development of 
            the site. I approached this phase in a specific order:
        </p>
        <ol class="process-list">
            <li>HTML structure was set up based on wireframes</li>
            <li>Added content to the home page</li>
            <li>Added content to one project page</li>
            <li>Styled the two pages with Sass and gulp.js</li>
            <li>Added JQuery plugins and JS scripts</li>
            <li>Created remaining project pages from the completed project page</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="single-work-description">
            The usage of Sass and gulp.js during the styling phase kept my code 
            organized and easy to work with. It also allowed me to make quick 
            tweaks and see the changes live, which significantly sped up the 
            development process. 
        </p>
        <p class="single-work-description">
            Both the mobile and desktop views of the site have fixed navigation 
            bars, with the mobile view having it at the bottom of the screen and 
            the desktop view having it on the side. This is to make going between 
            the different pages and sections quicker, as the user wouldn't have 
            to scroll back to the top of the page.
        </p>
        <div class="lightbox-gallery">
            <a href="images/mobile_nav.JPG" data-lightbox="portfolio-showcase" data-title="Mobile navigation for portfolio"><img src="images/mobile_nav.JPG" class="nav-screenshot" alt="screenshot of mobile navigation"></a>
            <a href="images/desktop_nav.JPG" data-lightbox="portfolio-showcase" data-title="Desktop navigation for portfolio"><img src="images/desktop_nav.JPG" class="nav-screenshot" alt="screenshot of desktop navigation"></a>
        </div>
        <p class="click-instruction">Click images to enlarge.</p>
        
        <p class="single-work-description">
            Headings and subheadings were also made keyboard-focusable for 
            keyboard users, and a return to top link was added at the bottom 
            of each page.
        </p>

    <section class="challenges">
        <h2 tabindex="0" class="single-sub-header">Challenges and Takeaways</h2>
        <p class="single-work-description">
            While this project was quite enjoyable overall, it wasn't without 
            its struggles. It was the first time I've put together a professional 
            portfolio for myself so I was very nervous about doing it the right 
            way. If anything, the majority of the struggles stemmed from the 
            thought of doing something that will directly impact my future.
        </p>
        <p class="single-work-description">
            Breaking down the process into stages and sticking to them greatly 
            facilitated both the design and development process, and completing 
            them before my personal deadlines allowed me to reflect on and make 
            improvements on my plans.
        </p>
