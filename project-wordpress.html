        <h3 class="single-sub-subheader">Planning</h3>
        <p class="single-work-description">
            The main goal for this project was to create a website that 
            advertises and sells a wedding photographer's services while 
            also functioning as their portfolio. The site was to have a 
            clean design and classic layout, with most of the focus being 
            on the photos. My team and I approached this project with the 
            following steps:
        </p>
        <ol class="process-list">
            <li>Review project brief with team</li>
            <li>Discovery meeting with client</li>
            <li>Creation of a memo of understanding</li>
            <li>Content plan and information architecture</li>
            <li>Development plan, wireframing, and mockups</li>
            <li>Development of the site</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="single-work-description">
            I created a Trello board for my team, with tasks organized into 
            the steps listed above. Tasks were assigned to and picked up by 
            team members as we progressed through the project.
        </p>
        <p class="single-work-description">
            After receiving the initial project brief from the client, 
            my team and I prepared several questions to clarify requirements 
            and better understand their goals. Notes were taken during the 
            meeting and referred to while creating the Memo of Understanding.
        </p>
        <p class="single-work-description">
            The Memo of Understanding served as a contract for the client:
            it outlined the requirements and what will be included in the site. 
            Once the client approved and signed off on the Memo of Understanding, 
            we proceeded to create the content plan and information architecture. 
            These would act as reference documents while we created the 
            development plan. 
        </p>
        <p class="single-work-description">
            With the content plan and information architecture complete, we then 
            continued onto the development planning stage. During this stage, my 
            team and gathered together and put together the following:
        </p>
        <ul class="process-unordered-list">
            <li>A list of development plugins to install and configure</li>
            <li>Custom post types to be created, complete with configuration info</li>
            <li>Custom taxonomies to be created, complete with configuration info</li>
            <li>Content storage- Advanced Custom Fields (ACF)</li>
            <li>Wireframes that also showed which PHP files to use on each page</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="single-work-description">
            After finishing the plan, I created a simple style tile to guide the 
            look of the site. I then created mockups based off the wireframes and 
            style tile.
        </p>

        <h3 tabindex="0" class="single-sub-subheader">Development</h3>
        <p class="single-work-description">
            With our development plan completed and mockups in hand, 
            we finally moved onto development of the site itself. I took 
            charge of setting up the needed PHP files, as well as registering 
            our custom post types, custom taxonomies, and ACFS.
        </p>
        <p class="single-work-description"> 
            My team then divided the tasks and began work. I focused on 
            asset creation and design tweaks while my team mates focused 
            on putting in content and writing code to output it. We would 
            meet every day and debrief on progress, helping each other 
            out with their tasks if needed.
        </p>
        <p class="single-work-description">
            Work with styling began after all content was successfully 
            outputted. Once I set up the necessary Sass variables, my 
            team split the styling workload by page.

    <section class="challenges">
        <h2 tabindex="0" class="single-sub-header">Project Takeaways</h2>
        
        <p class="single-work-description">
            As with most collaborative projects, communication and team work 
            was key to our ability to stay on track and work efficiently. We 
            were able to settle into a work routine that worked for all team members:
            our daily morning check-ins ensured we were able to help each other 
            if needed and working together over Zoom call allowed us to communicate 
            any changes that were necessary immediately. This meant we spent very 
            little time stuck on issues and were able to keep up to pace with 
            our schedule.
        </p>
        <p class="single-work-description">
            Having a solid and thorough development plan also played a large 
            role in streamlining our process. It took some time to put together, 
            but the result was a clearly laid-out and reliable plan we could 
            refer to at any point during the development process. This saved 
            us a lot of back-and-forth and was absolutely integral to our 
            process, and is something I will refer back to in future projects.
