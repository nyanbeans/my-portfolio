        <p class="single-work-description">
            The main goal for this project was to create a website that 
            advertises and sells a wedding photographer's services while 
            also functioning as their portfolio. The site was to have a 
            clean design and classic layout, with most of the focus being 
            on the photos. My team and I approached this project with the 
            following steps:
        </p>
        <ol class="process-list">
            <li>Review project brief with team</li>
            <li>Discovery meeting with client</li>
            <li>Creation of a memo of understanding</li>
            <li>Content plan and information architecture</li>
            <li>Development plan, wireframing, and mockups</li>
            <li>Development of the site</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="single-work-description">
            I created a Trello board for my team, with tasks organized into 
            the steps listed above. Tasks were assigned to and picked up by 
            team members as we progressed through the project.
        </p>
        <p class="single-work-description">
            After receiving the initial project brief from the client, 
            my team and I prepared several questions to clarify requirements 
            and better understand their goals. Notes were taken during the 
            meeting and referred to when creating the Memo of Understanding.
        </p>
        <p class="single-work-description">
            The Memo of Understanding served as a contract for the client:
            it outlined the requirements and what will be included in the site. 
            Once the client approved and signed off on the Memo of Understanding, 
            we proceeded to create the content plan and information architecture. 
            These would act as reference documents while we created the 
            development plan. 
        </p>
        <p class="single-work-description">
            With the content plan and information architecture complete, we then 
            continued onto the development planning stage. During this stage, my 
            team and gathered together and put together the following:
        </p>
        <ul class="process-unordered-list">
            <li>A list of development plugins to install and configure</li>
            <li>Custom post types to be created, complete with configuration info</li>
            <li>Custom taxonomies to be created, complete with configuration info</li>
            <li>Content storage- Advanced Custom Fields</li>
            <li>Wireframes that also showed which PHP files to use on each page</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="single-work-description">
            After finishing the plan, I created a simple style tile to guide the 
            look of the site and subsequently some mockups of the site.
        </p>

        <p class="single-work-description">
            With our development plan completed and mockups in hand, we finally 
            moved onto development of the site itself. 
        </p>
        <p class="single-work-description">
            I took charge of setting up the HTML structure for all the pages and 
            styling for half of them, while my team member was tasked with 
            styling the other half of the pages and JavaScript, as well as 
            the mobile navigation. GitHub was our platform of choice for 
            collaboration and version control.
