            The Tuxedo Cat is a fictional bar and lounge where patrons
            can go and relax, sipping on a good drink while in the company
            of a cat. It was built for a group project as part of the BCIT 
            Technical Web Development program. The website features a landing
            page, an interactive menu page, and reservation forms.

        <p class="single-work-description">
            Our approach going into this project can be broken down into 4 
            main steps:
        </p>
        <ol class="process-list">
            <li>Competitive analysis</li>
            <li>Content planning</li>
            <li>Wireframing and mockups</li>
            <li>Development</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="single-work-description">
            We first conducted research and analysis on potential competitors 
            to gather information on what content to include and come up with 
            keywords. Through our research, we found:
        </p>
        <ul class="process-unordered-list">
            <li>Many cat cafes offer cat adoption through rescue partnerships</li>
            <li>Cafe cats have introductions so customers can recognise them</li><!-- reword this -->
            <li>Online booking/reservation is always available</li>
            <li>Food and drink menus are almost always available</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="single-work-description">
            With this information, we created a rough content plan 
            and proceeded onto wireframes and mockups. Knowing that websites 
            should be coded mobile-first, I started with the mobile mockups 
            and built the desktop mockup with my teammate after it.

        <p class="single-work-description">
            After completion of the mockups, the work for development was
            divided between myself and my team member as follows: 
        </p>
        <p class="single-work-description">
            I took charge of setting up the HTML structure for all the pages and 
            styling for half of them, while my team member was tasked with 
            styling the other half of the pages and JavaScript, as well as 
            the mobile navigation. GitHub was our platform of choice for 
            collaboration and version control.

        </p>
        <p class="single-work-description">
            Being the second project to be assigned in the program, 
            this website was built very early on when I had little 
            knowledge of web development and web design in general.
            Now that the program is almost finished and I have much
            more knowledge, I can recognise a few areas where
            improvements can be made. 
        </p>
        <p class="single-work-description">
            To begin, The Tuxedo Cat's Menu page is not visually 
            accessible for users who can only navigate with keyboards; 
            no outlines show when users are tabbed over the menu page
            buttons. This was initially a design choice made without 
            knowledge of the :focus pseudo class's purpose and can 
            be fixed by removing the line of code that hides the 
            outline.
        </p>
        <p class="single-work-description">
            Menu page elements also do not adjust well with accessibility 
            settings, breaking when the browser font size is adjusted 
            to be bigger. This can be fixed by changing font sizes from 
            px sizing to rem sizing.
        </p>
        <h4 tabindex="0" class="single-sub-subheader">Takeaways</h4>
        <p class="single-work-description">
            While mistakes of this type are to be expected from a beginner, 
            they are still very much worth learning from because of the 
            impact they can have on a user's experience.
            Going forward, I'll do my best to approach projects with mindfulness 
            for accessibility. User testing should also be a part of the 
            process to determine usability and iron out prominent features.
