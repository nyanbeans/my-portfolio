        <p class="single-work-description">
            Our approach going into this project was divided by roles, which 
            overlapped whenever more assistance was needed for any specific 
            tasks. For this project, I handled the UI design and development, 
            as well as some asset creation and debugging. I also put together 
            the app structure to be output in JSX.
        </p>
        <p class="single-work-description">
            The mockups were created mobile-first, followed by desktop versions 
            with the following requirements in mind:
        </p>
        <ol class="process-list">
            <li>Four pages: Home, About, individual movie, Favourites</li>
            <li>Browse by: Popular, Top Rated, Now Playing, Upcoming</li>
            <li>A button or UI element that allows users to 'favourite' movies</li>
            <li>Responsive between 320px to 1980px.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p class="single-work-description">
            I approached the design with a mind of keeping the interface clean 
            and uncluttered, opting to display only the movie poster, title, 
            release date, and rating for each movie on the home and favourites 
            pages. Hovering over each poster with a cursor on desktop or pressing
            the movie poster on mobile would display an 
            excerpt from the summary of the movie, with a "more info" button 
            that takes the user to a page that displays more of the movie's 
            information.

            The mockups were created with Photoshop and make use of folder groups 
            to show UI changes with various user interactions.

        <h3 tabindex="0" class="single-sub-subheader">Development</h3>
        <p class="single-work-description">
            With the mockups complete, my teammate and I divided the workload 
            and began work on the development of the app itself. 
        </p>
        <p class="single-work-description">
            I started off with setting up the app structure, then turned them over to 
            my teammate once I'd finished with them. From here on, I worked on 
            styling the app's UI while my teammate worked on pulling in the data 
            dynamically. This was decided with the thought that it would reduce the 
            chances of code conflicts happening.
        </p>
        <p class="single-work-description">
            The final product differed a little from my mockups, as small changes 
            were made to improve usability during the development process.

        <h2 tabindex="0" class="single-sub-header">Challenges and Takeaways</h2>
        
        <p class="single-work-description">
            This was a project where communication was critical and 
            contributed greatly to the successful development of our 
            app. While I had done my best to set up the app structure 
            properly from the start, there were a few times where I had 
            to go back and edit a div or a class. Due to the ongoing 
            Covid-19 pandemic, we could not work together in person. 
            Instead, we set up online meetings to communicate through,  
            giving a heads up whenever there was a need to change the 
            code on what the other was working on.
        </p>
        <p class="single-work-description">
            There were also some differences between the mockups and 
            the final product. These changes were made during the 
            development process, when usability issues came up and 
            needed to be resolved. For instance:
        </p>
        <p class="single-work-description">
            The button to add a movie to favourites was only accessible 
            when hovering the cursor over the poster. This was changed 
            to be accessible without having to hover so keyboard and 
            mobile users can access it easily. A link to the individual 
            movie pages was also added to the movie titles upon realizing 
            not all users would know to hover or press on the movie poster 
            for more information. 
        </p>
        <h3 tabindex="0" class="single-sub-subheader">Takeaways</h3>
        <p class="single-work-description">
            The key takeaway from this project is to keep communication 
            as a top priority- I'm certain it would not have gone as 
            smoothly if we hadn't taken the extra steps to make sure 
            we always knew what we were working on. 
        </p>
        <p class="single-work-description">
            Being quick to come up with solutions and ready to make changes to 
            code after user testing is also still very important; 
            even if revisions to mockups were made and approval was solid, what 
            looks good visually isn't necessarily the best functionally.
